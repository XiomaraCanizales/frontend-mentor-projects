## My process

### Built with
- Map the elements to create the website
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first

### Continued development
- Semantic HTML5 markup is dificult because sometimes I don't know what type of markup to use.
- Mobile View is something I need to prioritize when creating a website, is easy to start with a bigger viewport and I need to improve working with other views.
